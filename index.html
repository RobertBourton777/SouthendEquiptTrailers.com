With a tight turning radius to navigate difficult spots and evenly distributed weight, it reduces the risk of property damage—and it won’t leave ruts in customers’ lawns.  The Equipter 4000’s 12-foot lift does the heavy lifting for you. Whether you’re lifting materials to the roof or lowering two tons of shingle debris to the ground, this roofing equipment improves your efficiency and maintains a much cleaner job site.  Lower the risk of property damage with its 4-foot roll-back feature, which allows you to position the container up and over customers’ flower beds, bushes, and other exterior features.  When the nearly 4,000-lb capacity container is full, position the Equipter 4000 lift next to a trailer, truck, or dumpster under 12 feet high. Then simply raise the container and unload it using the hydraulic tailgate.</td>

Use less shovel power and more Equipter power with a machine that will haul, spread, or position up to 4,740 pounds of materials, including dirt, rocks, mulch, plants, and trees. Its hinged tailgate and rear stabilizers combine for no-hassle dumping, even on uneven terrain.  With a rust-proof aluminum body that measures about 6 feet wide by 13 feet long, the compact Equipter 3300 trailer hauls materials places you wouldn’t dare take bulky trailers, big dumpsters, or work trucks. Use its precision turning to maneuver around tight spots, like established landscaping or residential lots.  Any similarities with other trailers end once the Equipter 3300 trailer is on the job site. Engage its gas-powered engine to drive and position this rugged contracting equipment on construction sites as well as residential and commercial properties.</td>

Once you’re on site, fire up its gas-powered engine to navigate this compact dumpster through alleyways, down narrow sidewalks and stone paths, nearly anywhere it's needed.  After filling the 1.76 cubic yard container, use the lift’s engine to drive the aluminum container to an on-site dump truck, trailer, or another disposal spot. The easy-to-operate control panel lets you raise the lightweight container up to 7 feet to easily dump the debris via the hydraulic tailgate. On-site debris disposal really can be as simple as that.  This compact, lightweight dumpster is specifically designed to fit in places other contractor equipment can’t. Its 4-foot 4-inch wide chassis and easy maneuverability allows you to navigate into hard-to-reach areas, like alleyways, to catch falling debris.  Lift materials up to your level with the Equipter 2500’s 7-foot lift and secure the sturdy stabilizers to position the aluminum container right where you need it. This also cuts the distance debris will fall, helping reduce the risk of damage to your customer's property.</td>
